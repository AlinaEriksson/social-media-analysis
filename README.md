# Social Media Analysis

## Why? 
> Information is only useful when it can be understood. 

I want to know more about the data that websites have on me! There are too many to count almost. 

The goal is to analyse the data and create scripts so you also get some knowledge about what they have on you, even if you have no previous knowledge about data analysis.
